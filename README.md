# hophop
Hophop is a fun and educational game where a little animal jumps over obstacles by clicking the screen. Players must avoid sweets and collect fruits and vegetables to earn points. The game gradually increases speed and changes backgrounds through the four seasons, promoting coordination, attention, and healthy habits.
